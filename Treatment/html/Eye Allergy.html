<h1 id="eye-allergies">Eye Allergies</h1>
<p>Eye allergies are also known as “allergic conjunctivitis.” Just like any other allergic reaction, they are caused by a misfiring of the immune system, the body’s natural defense mechanism.</p>
<p>When you have allergies, your body reacts to things that aren’t really harmful, like pollen, dust mites, mold, or pet dander. It releases histamine, a chemical that causes swelling and inflammation. The blood vessels in your eyes swell and your eyes get red, teary, and itchy.</p>
<p>You can be allergic to: Continue Reading Below</p>
<pre><code>1. **Pollen from grasses, weeds, and trees**. These are the most common kinds of eye allergies and are called seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.
2. **Dust, pet dander, and other indoor allergens**. These eye allergies last year-round and are called chronic (perennial) conjunctivitis.
3. **Makeup, perfume, or other chemicals** can trigger eye allergies called contact conjunctivitis.
4. **An allergy to contact lenses, called giant papillary conjunctivitis**, can cause bumps on the inside of your eyelid, making your eyes sensitive and red both with and without wearing your contact lenses.</code></pre>
<h2 id="treating-eye-allergies">Treating Eye Allergies</h2>
<p>Some of the same medicines you use for nasal allergies work for eye allergies. For quick relief, over-the-counter eye drops and pills can help.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways to Reduce Symptoms</strong></p>
<pre><code>1. Wear sunglasses when you go outside. They&#39;ll block some of the pollen and other outdoor allergens from getting into your eyes.
2. Rinse your eyes with preservative-free saline water or apply a cold, wet washcloth. 
3. Use lubricating eye drops (artificial tears) to moisten dry eyes and wash out allergens.
4. Take out your contact lenses.
5. Don’t rub your eyes, no matter how much they itch. It will only make the irritation worse.</code></pre>
<p>Call your doctor right away if you develop severe eye pain or vision loss.</p>
