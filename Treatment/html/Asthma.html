<h1 class="title">Asthma</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Asthma</strong> is an inflammatory disease of the airways to the lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities difficult or even impossible. Normally, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose and down into your throat, into your airways, eventually making it to your lungs. There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.</p>
<p>Asthma symptoms occur when the lining of your airways swell and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills the airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through.</p>
<p>These conditions then bring on an asthma “attack,” the coughing and tightness in your chest that is typical of asthma.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p><strong>Physical exam</strong></p>
<p>To rule out other possible conditions — such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. <strong>Tests to measure lung function</strong></p>
<p>You may also be given lung (pulmonary) function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Spirometry**. This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out.
2. **Peak flow**. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings.</code></pre>
<p>Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol, to open your airways. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it’s likely you have asthma. <strong>Additional tests</strong></p>
<p>Other tests to diagnose asthma include:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Methacholine challenge**. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger that, when inhaled, will cause mild constriction of your airways. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal.
2. **Nitric oxide test**. This test, though not widely available, measures the amount of the gas, nitric oxide, that you have in your breath. When your airways are inflamed — a sign of asthma — you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels.
3. **Imaging tests**. A chest X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan of your lungs and nose cavities (sinuses) can identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems.
4. **Allergy testing**. This can be performed by a skin test or blood test. Allergy tests can identify allergy to pets, dust, mold and pollen. If important allergy triggers are identified, this can lead to a recommendation for allergen immunotherapy.
5. **Sputum eosinophils**. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye (eosin).
6. **Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma**. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Treatment of asthma</strong></p>
<p><em>Treatments for asthma fall into three primary categories: breathing exercises, rescue or first aid treatments, and long-term asthma control medications.</em></p>
<p>Your doctor will determine the right treatment or combination of treatments for you based on the type of asthma you have, your age, and your triggers. Breathing exercises</p>
<p>These exercises can help you get more air into and out of your lungs. Over time, this may help increase lung capacity and cut down on severe asthma symptoms. Your doctor or an occupational therapist can help you learn these breathing exercises for asthma. Rescue or first aid treatments</p>
<p>These medications should only be used in the event of an asthma attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again. Examples include:</p>
<pre><code>1. rescue inhalers and nebulizers, which are used with medicine that needs to be inhaled deep into the lungs
2. bronchodilators, which work to relax the tightened muscles in your lung
3. anti-inflammatories, which target inflammation in your lungs that could be preventing your breathing</code></pre>
<p>If you think that someone you know is having an asthma attack, you should sit them upright and assist them in using their rescue inhaler or nebulizer. Two to six puffs of medication should help ease their symptoms.</p>
<p>If symptoms persist for more than 20 minutes, and a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek medical attention. Long-term asthma control mediations</p>
<p>These medications should be taken daily to prevent symptoms. Some rescue treatments, such as inhalers and nebulizers, can be used daily. However, your doctor will need to adjust your dosages.</p>
<p><strong>Asthma home remedies</strong></p>
<p>Complementary and alternative therapies should never be used during an asthma attack. If not treated properly, asthma can be life-threatening. The following remedies may help with mild asthma, but an asthma attack is a medical emergency. Follow your doctor’s instructions and make sure an inhaler is available in case you need it. Coffee or caffeinated tea</p>
<p>A chemical in caffeine acts similarly to the asthma drug theophylline. It opens up airways and may ease symptoms of asthma for up to four hours. Essential oils</p>
<p>Inhaling eucalyptus essential oil may ease breathing difficulties brought on by asthma. Lavender and basil essential oils also show promise. However, for some individuals, inhaling essential oils may make asthma worse. Strong smells and chemicals can trigger asthma or worsen symptoms. Mustard oil</p>
<p>This fatty oil, made from pressed mustard seeds, can be massaged into the skin to help open airways. Mustard oil is different than mustard essential oil, a medicinal oil which shouldn’t be applied directly to the skin.</p>
