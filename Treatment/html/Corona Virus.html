<h1 id="corona---covid-19">Corona - Covid-19</h1>
<p>In early 2020, a new virus began generating headlines all over the world because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission.</p>
<p>From its origins in a food market in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, to countries as far-flung as the United States and the Philippines, the virus (officially named SARS-CoV-2) has been responsible for millions of infections globally, causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The United States is the most affected country.</p>
<p>The disease caused by an infection with SARS-CoV-2 is called COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019.</p>
<p>In spite of the global panic in the news about this virus, you’re unlikely to contract SARS-CoV-2 unless you’ve been in contact with someone who has a SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>If you develop symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and you’ve been exposed to the virus, contact your doctor. Tell him or her if you’ve traveled to any areas with ongoing community spread of COVID-19 according to CDC and WHO. Also let your doctor know if you’ve had close contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Factors used to decide whether to test you for COVID-19 may differ depending on where you live. Depending on your location, you may need to be screened by your clinic to determine if testing is appropriate and available.</p>
<p>In the U.S., your doctor will determine whether to conduct tests for COVID-19 based on your signs and symptoms, as well as whether you have had close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 or traveled to or lived in any areas with ongoing community spread of COVID-19 in the past 14 days. Your doctor may also consider testing if you’re at higher risk of serious illness.</p>
<p><em>To test for COVID-19, a health care provider uses a long swab to take a nasal sample. The sample is then sent to a lab for testing. If you’re coughing up saliva (sputum), that may be sent for testing.</em></p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p>Currently, no antiviral medication is recommended to treat COVID-19, and no cure is available for COVID-19. Antibiotics aren’t effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. Ongoing research is studying various drugs that may be effective for treating severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>Treatment is directed at relieving symptoms and may include:</p>
<pre><code>1. Pain relievers (ibuprofen or acetaminophen)
2. Cough syrup or medication
3. Rest
4. Fluid intake</code></pre>
<p>There is no evidence that ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) need to be avoided.</p>
<p>If you have mild symptoms, your doctor may recommend that you recover at home. He or she may give you special instructions to monitor your symptoms and to avoid spreading the illness to others. You may be asked to isolate yourself as much as possible from family and pets while you’re sick, wear a mask when you’re around people, and to use a separate bedroom and bathroom. Your doctor will likely recommend that you stay in home isolation for a period of time except to get medical care. Your doctor will likely follow up with you regularly. Check with your doctor about when you can end home isolation.</p>
<p>If you’re very ill, you may need to be treated in the hospital.</p>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>Although there is no vaccine available to prevent COVID-19, you can take steps to reduce your risk of infection. WHO and CDC recommend following these precautions for avoiding COVID-19:</p>
<pre><code>1. Avoid large events and mass gatherings.
2. Avoid close contact (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) with anyone who is sick or has symptoms.
3. Stay home as much as possible and keep distance between yourself and others (within about 6 feet, or 2 meters) if COVID-19 is spreading in your community, especially if you have a higher risk of serious illness. Keep in mind some people may have COVID-19 and spread it to others, even if they don&#39;t have symptoms or don&#39;t know they have COVID-19.
4. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.
5. Cover your face with a cloth face covering in public spaces, such as the grocery store, where it&#39;s difficult to avoid close contact with others, especially if you&#39;re in an area with ongoing community spread. Only use nonmedical cloth masks — surgical masks and N95 respirators should be reserved for health care providers.
6. Cover your mouth and nose with your elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away the used tissue.
7. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth.
8. Avoid sharing dishes, glasses, bedding and other household items if you&#39;re sick.
9. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces daily.
10. Stay home from work, school and public areas if you&#39;re sick, unless you&#39;re going to get medical care. Avoid taking public transportation if you&#39;re sick.</code></pre>
<p>If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.</p>
