<h1 class="title">Anemia</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Anemia</strong> occurs when you have a decreased level of hemoglobin in your red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin is the protein in your RBCs that is responsible for carrying oxygen to your tissues.</p>
<p><strong>Iron deficiency anemia</strong> <em>is the most common type of anemia</em>, and it occurs when your body doesn’t have enough of the mineral iron. Your body needs iron to make hemoglobin. When there isn’t enough iron in your blood stream, the rest of your body can’t get the amount of oxygen it needs.</p>
<p>While the condition may be common, many people don’t know they have iron deficiency anemia. It’s possible to experience the symptoms for years without ever knowing the cause.</p>
<p><strong>In women</strong> of childbearing age, the most common cause of iron deficiency anemia is a loss of iron in the blood due to heavy menstruation or pregnancy. A poor diet or certain intestinal diseases that affect how the body absorbs iron can also cause iron deficiency anemia.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>To diagnose anemia, your doctor is likely to ask you about your medical and family history, perform a physical exam, and run the following tests:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Complete blood count (CBC)**. A CBC is used to count the number of blood cells in a sample of your blood. For anemia, your doctor will be interested in the levels of the red blood cells contained in your blood (hematocrit) and the hemoglobin in your blood.

Normal adult hematocrit values vary among medical practices but are generally between 40% and 52% for men and 35% and 47% for women. Normal adult hemoglobin values are generally 14 to 18 grams per deciliter for men and 12 to 16 grams per deciliter for women.
2. **A test to determine the size and shape of your red blood cells**. Some of your red blood cells might also be examined for unusual size, shape and color.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Additional diagnostic tests</strong></p>
<p>If you receive a diagnosis of anemia, your doctor might order additional tests to determine the cause. Occasionally, it can be necessary to study a sample of your bone marrow to diagnose anemia.</p>
<p><strong>Treatment options</strong></p>
<p><strong>Iron supplements</strong></p>
<p>Iron tablets can help restore iron levels in your body. If possible, you should take iron tablets on an empty stomach, which helps the body absorb them better. If they upset your stomach, you can take them with meals. You may need to take the supplements for several months. Iron supplements may cause constipation or black stools. Diet</p>
<p>Diets that include the following foods can help treat or prevent iron deficiency:</p>
<pre><code>1. dark green, leafy vegetables
2. dried fruits
3. nuts
4. iron-fortified cereals </code></pre>
<p>Additionally, vitamin C helps your body absorb iron. If you’re taking iron tablets, a doctor might suggest taking the tablets along with a source of vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice or citrus fruit. Treating the underlying cause of bleeding</p>
<p>Iron supplements won’t help if excess bleeding causes the deficiency. A doctor may prescribe birth control pills to women who have heavy periods. This can reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding each month.</p>
<p><em>In the most severe cases, a blood transfusion can replace iron and blood loss quickly.</em> ## Prevention</p>
<p>When caused by inadequate iron intake, iron deficiency anemia can be prevented by eating a diet high in iron-rich foods and vitamin C. Mothers should make sure to feed their babies breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula.</p>
<p><em>Foods high in iron include:</em></p>
<pre><code>1. beans
2. pumpkin and squash seeds
3. leafy greens, such as spinach
4. raisins and other dried fruit
5. eggs
6. seafood, such as clams, sardines, shrimp, and oysters
7. iron-fortified dry and instant cereals</code></pre>
<p><em>Foods high in vitamin C include:</em></p>
<pre><code>1. fruits such as oranges, grapefruits, strawberries, kiwis, guavas, papayas, pineapples, melons, and mangoes
2. broccoli
3. red and green bell peppers
4. Brussels sprouts
5. cauliflower
6. tomatoes
7. leafy greens</code></pre>
