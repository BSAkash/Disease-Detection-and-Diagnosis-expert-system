<h1 class="title">Tuberculosis</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Tuberculosis</strong> (TB) is a potentially serious infectious disease that mainly affects your lungs. The bacteria that cause tuberculosis are spread from one person to another through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>Many strains of tuberculosis resist the drugs most used to treat the disease. People with active tuberculosis must take several types of medications for many months to eradicate the infection and prevent development of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>During the physical exam, your doctor will check your lymph nodes for swelling and use a stethoscope to listen carefully to the sounds your lungs make while you breathe.</p>
<p>The most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a simple skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin is injected just below the skin of your inside forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.</p>
<p>Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you’re likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant. <strong>Results can be wrong</strong></p>
<p><em>The TB skin test isn’t perfect</em>. Sometimes, it suggests that people have TB when they really don’t. It can also indicate that people don’t have TB when they really do.</p>
<p>A false-positive test may happen if you’ve been vaccinated recently with the bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine. This tuberculosis vaccine is seldom used in the United States but is widely used in countries with high TB infection rates.</p>
<p><em>False-negative results may occur in certain populations</em> — including children, older people and people with AIDS — who sometimes don’t respond to the TB skin test. A false-negative result can also occur in people who’ve recently been infected with TB, but whose immune systems haven’t yet reacted to the bacteria. <strong>Blood tests</strong></p>
<p>Blood tests may be used to confirm or rule out latent or active tuberculosis. These tests use sophisticated technology to measure your immune system’s reaction to TB bacteria.</p>
<p>These tests require only one office visit. A blood test may be useful if you’re at high risk of TB infection but have a negative response to the skin test, or if you’ve recently received the BCG vaccine. <strong>Imaging tests</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve had a positive skin test, your doctor is likely to order a chest X-ray or a CT scan. This may show white spots in your lungs where your immune system has walled off TB bacteria, or it may reveal changes in your lungs caused by active tuberculosis. CT scans provide more-detailed images than do X-rays. <strong>Sputum tests</strong></p>
<p>If your chest X-ray shows signs of tuberculosis, your doctor may take samples of your sputum — the mucus that comes up when you cough. The samples are tested for TB bacteria.</p>
<p>Sputum samples can also be used to test for drug-resistant strains of TB. This helps your doctor choose the medications that are most likely to work. These tests can take four to eight weeks to be completed.</p>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p>With early detection and appropriate antibiotics, TB is treatable.</p>
<p>The right type of antibiotic and length of treatment will depend on:</p>
<pre><code>1. the person’s age and overall health
2. whether they have latent or active TB
3. the location of the infection
4. whether the strain of TB is drug resistant</code></pre>
<p>Treatment for latent TB can vary. It may involve taking an antibiotic once a week for 12 weeks or every day for 9 months.</p>
<p>Treatment for active TB may involve taking several drugs for 6–9 months. When a person has a drug resistant strain of TB, the treatment will be more complex.</p>
<p>It is essential to complete the full course of treatment, even if symptoms go away. If a person stops taking their medication early, some bacteria can survive and become resistant to antibiotics. In this case, the person may go on to develop drug resistant TB.</p>
<p>Depending on the parts of the body that TB affects, a doctor may also prescribe corticosteroids.</p>
