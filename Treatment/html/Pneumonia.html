<h1 class="title">Pneumonia</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Pneumonia</strong> is a bacterial or viral infection of the lungs. Symptoms can include fever, chills, shortness of breath, coughing that produces phlegm, and chest pain.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Your doctor will start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for abnormal bubbling or crackling sounds that suggest pneumonia.</p>
<p>If pneumonia is suspected, your doctor may recommend the following tests:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Blood tests**. Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn&#39;t always possible.
2. **Chest X-ray**. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can&#39;t tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.
3. **Pulse oximetry**. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.
4. **Sputum test**. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection.</code></pre>
<p>Your doctor might order additional tests if you’re older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include:</p>
<pre><code>1. **CT scan**. If your pneumonia isn&#39;t clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.
2. **Pleural fluid culture.** A fluid sample is taken by putting a needle between your ribs from the pleural area and analyzed to help determine the type of infection.</code></pre>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p>Most cases of pneumonia can be treated at home. However, babies, children, and people with severe pneumonia may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics, even if viral pneumonia is suspected as there may be a degree of bacterial infection as well. The type of antibiotic used and the way it is given will be determined by the severity and cause of the pneumonia.</p>
<p><strong>Home-based treatment</strong> usually includes:</p>
<pre><code>1. Antibiotics - given by mouth as tablets or liquid
2. Pain-relieving medications
3. Paracetamol to reduce fever
4. Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to help loosen mucus in the lungs
5. Rest.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Hospital-based treatment</strong> usually includes:</p>
<pre><code>1. Antibiotics given intravenously (via a drip into a vein)
2. Oxygen therapy - to ensure the body gets the oxygen it needs
3. Intravenous fluids - to correct dehydration or if the person is too unwell to eat or drink
4. Physiotherapy - to help clear the sputum from the lungs.</code></pre>
<p><strong>Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Pneumonia may take several weeks to fully recover from. The cough may continue until the mucus has been cleared from the lungs. This is a part of the recovery process. Fatigue and a reduced ability to exercise may also be experienced.</p>
<p>If the cough gets worse or recovery is taking longer than several weeks, see a doctor for further assessment. Smokers should have a chest x-ray after six weeks to confirm complete clearance of the lungs.</p>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>The following steps can be taken to reduce the risk of contracting pneumonia:</p>
<pre><code>1. Breastfeeding your baby (preferably beyond four months) – to help boost their immune system
2. Quit smoking and ensure a smoke-free household
3. Keeping your home warm and well-ventilated
4. Vaccination, in particular against pneumococcal disease, whooping cough , Hib (Haemophilus influenza type b), and influenza
5. Regular and thorough hand-washing
6. Avoiding contact with people who have colds, the flu, or other infections.</code></pre>
<p><em>Vaccines against pneumococcal disease may not always prevent pneumonia but they may prevent serious complications of pneumonia should infection occur.</em></p>
