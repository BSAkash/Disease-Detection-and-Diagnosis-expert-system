<h1 class="title">Hepatitis</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Hepatitis</strong> means “inflammation of the liver”. A liver can become inflamed for many reasons, such as too much alcohol, physical injury, autoimmune response, or a reaction to bacteria or a virus. The five most common hepatitis viruses are A, B, C, D, and E. Some hepatitis viruses can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, or even liver cancer. Damage to the liver reduces its ability to function and makes it harder for your body to filter out toxins.</p>
<p><strong>How hepatitis is diagnosed</strong> <strong>History and physical exam</strong></p>
<p>To diagnose hepatitis, first your doctor will take your history to determine any risk factors you may have for infectious or noninfectious hepatitis.</p>
<p>During a physical examination, your doctor may press down gently on your abdomen to see if there’s pain or tenderness. Your doctor may also feel to see if your liver is enlarged. If your skin or eyes are yellow, your doctor will note this during the exam. <strong>Liver function tests</strong></p>
<p>Liver function tests use blood samples to determine how efficiently your liver works. Abnormal results of these tests may be the first indication that there is a problem, especially if you don’t show any signs on a physical exam of liver disease. High liver enzyme levels may indicate that your liver is stressed, damaged, or not functioning properly. Other blood tests</p>
<p>If your liver function tests are abnormal, your doctor will likely order other bloodtests to detect the source of the problem. These tests can check for the viruses that cause hepatitis. They can also be used to check for antibodies that are common in conditions like autoimmune hepatitis. <strong>Ultrasound</strong></p>
<p>An abdominal ultrasound uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the organs within your abdomen. This test allows your doctor to take a close at your liver and nearby organs. It can reveal:</p>
<pre><code>1. fluid in your abdomen
2. liver damage or enlargement
3. liver tumors
4. abnormalities of your gallbladder</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes the pancreas shows up on ultrasound images as well. This can be a useful test in determining the cause of your abnormal liver function. <strong>Liver biopsy</strong></p>
<p>A liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that involves your doctor taking a sample of tissue from your liver. It can be done through your skin with a needle and doesn’t require surgery. Typically, an ultrasound is used to guide your doctor when taking the biopsy sample.</p>
<p>This test allows your doctor to determine how infection or inflammation has affected your liver. It can also be used to sample any areas in your liver that appear abnormal. <strong>How hepatitis is treated</strong></p>
<p>Treatment options are determined by which type of hepatitis you have and whether the infection is acute or chronic. <strong>Hepatitis A</strong></p>
<p>Hepatitis A usually doesn’t require treatment because it’s a short-term illness. Bed rest may be recommended if symptoms cause a great deal of discomfort. If you experience vomiting or diarrhea, follow your doctor’s orders for hydration and nutrition.</p>
<p>The hepatitis A vaccine is available to prevent this infection. Most children begin vaccination between ages 12 and 18 months. It’s a series of two vaccines. Vaccination for hepatitis A is also available for adults and can be combined with the hepatitis B vaccine. <strong>Hepatitis B</strong></p>
<p>Acute hepatitis B doesn’t require specific treatment.</p>
<p>Chronic hepatitis B is treated with antiviral medications. This form of treatment can be costly because it must be continued for several months or years. Treatment for chronic hepatitis B also requires regular medical evaluations and monitoring to determine if the virus is responding to treatment.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B can be prevented with vaccination. The CDCTrusted Source recommends hepatitis B vaccinations for all newborns. The series of three vaccines is typically completed over the first six months of childhood. The vaccine is also recommended for all healthcare and medical personnel. <strong>Hepatitis C</strong></p>
<p>Antiviral medications are used to treat both acute and chronic forms of hepatitis C. People who develop chronic hepatitis C are typically treated with a combination of antiviral drug therapies. They may also need further testing to determine the best form of treatment.</p>
<p>People who develop cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) or liver disease as a result of chronic hepatitis C may be candidates for a liver transplant.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no vaccination for hepatitis C. <strong>Hepatitis D</strong></p>
<p>No antiviral medications exist for the treatment of hepatitis D at this time. According to a 2013 studyTrusted Source, a drug called alpha interferon can be used to treat hepatitis D, but it only shows improvement in about 25 to 30 percent of people.</p>
<p>Hepatitis D can be prevented by getting the vaccination for hepatitis B, as infection with hepatitis B is necessary for hepatitis D to develop. <strong>Hepatitis E</strong></p>
<p>Currently, no specific medical therapies are available to treat hepatitis E. Because the infection is often acute, it typically resolves on its own. People with this type of infection are often advised to get adequate rest, drink plenty of fluids, get enough nutrients, and avoid alcohol. However, pregnant women who develop this infection require close monitoring and care. <strong>Autoimmune hepatitis</strong></p>
<p>Corticosteroids, like prednisone or budesonide, are extremely important in the early treatment of autoimmune hepatitis. They’re effective in about 80 percent of people with this condition.</p>
<p>Azothioprine (Imuran), a drug that suppresses the immune system, is often included in treatment. It can be used with or without steroids.</p>
<p>Other immune suppressing drugs like mycophenolate (CellCept), tacrolimus (Prograf) and cyclosporine (Neoral) can also be used as alternatives to azathioprine for treatment. <strong>Tips to prevent hepatitis</strong> <strong>Hygiene</strong></p>
<p>Practicing good hygiene is one key way to avoid contracting hepatitis A and E. If you’re traveling to a developing country, you should avoid:</p>
<pre><code>1. local water
2. ice
3. raw or undercooked shellfish and oysters
4. raw fruit and vegetables</code></pre>
<p>Hepatitis B, C, and D contracted through contaminated blood can be prevented by:</p>
<pre><code>1. not sharing drug needles
2. not sharing razors
3. not using someone else’s toothbrush
4. not touching spilled blood</code></pre>
<p>Hepatitis B and C can also be contracted through sexual intercourse and intimate sexual contact. Practicing safe sex by using condoms and dental dams can help decrease the risk of infection. You can find many options available for purchase online. <strong>Vaccines</strong></p>
<p>The use of vaccines is an important key to preventing hepatitis. Vaccinations are available to prevent the development of hepatitis A and B. Experts are currently developing vaccines against hepatitis C. A vaccination for hepatitis E exists in China, but it isn’t available in the United States.</p>
