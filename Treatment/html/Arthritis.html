<h1 id="arthritis">Arthritis</h1>
<p><strong>Arthritis</strong> is the swelling and tenderness of one or more of your joints. The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are <em>osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.</em></p>
<p>Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.</p>
<p>Uric acid crystals, which form when there’s too much uric acid in your blood, can cause gout. Infections or underlying disease, such as psoriasis or lupus, can cause other types of arthritis.</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>During the physical exam, your doctor will check your joints for swelling, redness and warmth. He or she will also want to see how well you can move your joints.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of arthritis suspected, your doctor may suggest some of the following tests. <strong>Laboratory tests</strong></p>
<p>The analysis of different types of body fluids can help pinpoint the type of arthritis you may have. Fluids commonly analyzed include blood, urine and joint fluid. To obtain a sample of your joint fluid, your doctor will cleanse and numb the area before inserting a needle in your joint space to withdraw some fluid. <strong>Imaging</strong></p>
<p>These types of tests can detect problems within your joint that may be causing your symptoms. Examples include:</p>
<pre><code>1. **X-rays**. Using low levels of radiation to visualize bone, X-rays can show cartilage loss, bone damage and bone spurs. X-rays may not reveal early arthritic damage, but they are often used to track progression of the disease.
2. **Computerized tomography (CT)**. CT scanners take X-rays from many different angles and combine the information to create cross-sectional views of internal structures. CTs can visualize both bone and the surrounding soft tissues.
3. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**. Combining radio waves with a strong magnetic field, MRI can produce more-detailed cross-sectional images of soft tissues such as cartilage, tendons and ligaments.
4. **Ultrasound**. This technology uses high-frequency sound waves to image soft tissues, cartilage and fluid-containing structures near the joints (bursae). Ultrasound is also used to guide needle placement for joint aspirations and injections.</code></pre>
<p><strong>How is arthritis treated?</strong></p>
<p>The main goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of pain you’re experiencing and prevent additional damage to the joints. You’ll learn what works best for you in terms of controlling pain. Some people find heating pads and ice packs to be soothing. Others use mobility assistance devices, like canes or walkers, to help take pressure off sore joints.</p>
<p>Improving your joint function is also important. Your doctor may prescribe you a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results.</p>
<p><strong>Medication</strong></p>
<p>A number of different types of medication treat arthritis:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Analgesics**, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but don’t help decrease inflammation.
2. **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**, such as ibuprofen (Advil) and salicylates, help control pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should be used very cautiously with additional blood thinning medications.
3. **Menthol or capsaicin creams** block the transmission of pain signals from your joints.
4. **Immunosuppressants** like prednisone or cortisone help reduce inflammation.</code></pre>
<p>If you have Rheumatoid Arthritis, your doctor may put you on corticosteroids or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system. There are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery</strong></p>
<p>Surgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replace hips and knees.</p>
<p>If your arthritis is most severe in your fingers or wrists, your doctor may perform a joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are locked together until they heal and become one. <strong>Physical therapy</strong></p>
<p>Physical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment. What lifestyle changes can help people with arthritis?</p>
<p>Weight loss and maintaining a healthy weight reduce the risk of developing OA and can reduce symptoms if you already have it.</p>
<p>Eating a healthy diet is important for weight loss. Choosing a diet with lots of antioxidants, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, can help reduce inflammation. Other inflammation-reducing foods include fish and nuts.</p>
<p>Foods to minimize or avoid if you have arthritis include fried foods, processed foods, dairy products, and high intakes of meat.</p>
<p>Some research also suggests that gluten antibodies may be present in people with RA. A gluten-free diet may improve symptoms and disease progression. A 2015 study also recommends a gluten-free diet for all people who receive a diagnosis of undifferentiated connective tissue disease.</p>
<p>Regular exercise will keep your joints flexible. Swimming is often a good form of exercise for people with arthritis because it doesn’t put pressure on your joints the way running and walking do. Staying active is important, but you should also be sure to rest when you need to and avoid overexerting yourself.</p>
<p>At-home exercises you can try include:</p>
<pre><code>1. the head tilt, neck rotation, and other exercises to relieve pain in your neck
2. finger bends and thumb bends to ease pain in your hands
3. leg raises, hamstring stretches, and other easy exercises for knee arthritis</code></pre>
