<h1 class="title">Bronchitis</h1>
</header>
<p><strong>Bronchitis</strong> is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes, which carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may be either acute or chronic.</p>
<p>Often developing from a cold or other respiratory infection, acute bronchitis is very common. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking.</p>
<p>Acute bronchitis, also called a chest cold, usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks.</p>
<p>However, if you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<h2 id="diagnosis">Diagnosis</h2>
<p>During the first few days of illness, it can be difficult to distinguish the signs and symptoms of bronchitis from those of a common cold. During the physical exam, your doctor will use a stethoscope to listen closely to your lungs as you breathe.</p>
<p>In some cases, your doctor may suggest the following tests:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Chest X-ray**. A chest X-ray can help determine if you have pneumonia or another condition that may explain your cough. This is especially important if you ever were or currently are a smoker.
2. **Sputum tests**. Sputum is the mucus that you cough up from your lungs. It can be tested to see if you have illnesses that could be helped by antibiotics. Sputum can also be tested for signs of allergies.
3. b. During a pulmonary function test, you blow into a device called a spirometer, which measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can get air out of your lungs. This test checks for signs of asthma or emphysema.</code></pre>
<h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
<p>To reduce your risk of bronchitis, follow these tips:</p>
<pre><code>1. **Avoid cigarette smoke**. Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis.
2. **Get vaccinated**. Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. You may also want to consider vaccination that protects against some types of pneumonia.
3. **Wash your hands**. To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
4. **Wear a surgical mask**. If you have COPD, you might consider wearing a face mask at work if you&#39;re exposed to dust or fumes, and when you&#39;re going to be among crowds, such as while traveling.</code></pre>
<h2 id="treatment">Treatment</h2>
<p>A doctor may advise a person with bronchitis to:</p>
<pre><code>1. rest
2. drink fluids
3. take over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such as ibuprofen</code></pre>
<p>Taking OTC medication will help relieve a cough and ease any accompanying pain. In time, acute bronchitis will go away, often without treatment.</p>
<p>The symptoms of chronic bronchitis may resolve or improve for a while. However, they will come back or become worse again, especially if there is exposure to smoke or other triggers.</p>
<p>Options that may help include:</p>
<p><strong>Cough medicine</strong>: Coughing is useful for removing mucus from the bronchial tubes, but medication can help bring relief, for example, at night.</p>
<p>Cough medicine is available for purchase online.</p>
<p><strong>Taking honey</strong>: Taking 2 spoonfuls of honey may bring relief of cough symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Using a humidifier</strong>: This can loosen mucus, improve airflow, and relieve wheezing.</p>
<p><strong>Bronchodilators</strong>: These open the bronchial tubes and may help clear out mucus.</p>
<p><strong>Mucolytics</strong>: These loosen or thin mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up sputum.</p>
<p><strong>Anti-inflammatory and steroid drugs</strong>: These can help reduce inflammation that can cause tissue damage.</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen therapy</strong>: In severe cases, a person may need supplemental oxygen to ease their breathing.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral remedies</strong></p>
<p>Other strategies for treating bronchitis include the following:</p>
<pre><code>1. removing a lung irritant, for example, by not smoking
2. exercising to strengthen the chest muscles to help breathing
3. improving breathing technique through pulmonary rehabilitation</code></pre>
<p><em>Doing breathing exercises, such as pursed-lip breathing, can help slow down breathing, and make it more effective.</em></p>
<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>
<p>If acute bronchitis results from a bacterial infection, a doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Taking antibiotics may also help prevent a secondary infection, in some cases.</p>
<p><em>These drugs are not suitable for a person with a virus, however.</em></p>
<p>Most doctors will not prescribe antibiotics unless they have identified bacteria as the cause of an illness. One of the reasons for this is concern about antibiotic resistance, as overuse of antibiotics makes it harder to treat an infection in the long term.</p>
