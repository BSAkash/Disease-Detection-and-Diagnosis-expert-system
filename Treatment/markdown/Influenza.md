# Influenza

**Influenza** is a viral infection that attacks your respiratory system â€” your nose, throat and lungs. Influenza is commonly called the flu, but it's not the same as stomach "flu" viruses that cause diarrhea and vomiting.

For most people, influenza resolves on its own. But sometimes, influenza and its complications can be deadly. People at higher risk of developing flu complications include:

    1. Young children under age 5, and especially those under 12 months
    2. Adults older than age 65
    3. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities
    4. Pregnant women and women up to two weeks postpartum
    5. People with weakened immune systems
    6. People who have chronic illnesses, such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease and diabetes
    7. People who are very obese, with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher

Though the annual influenza vaccine isn't 100 percent effective, it's still your best defense against the flu.

## Diagnosis

Your doctor will conduct a physical exam, look for signs and symptoms of influenza, and possibly order a test that detects influenza viruses.

During times when influenza is widespread, you may not need to be tested for influenza. Your doctor may diagnose you based on your signs and symptoms.

In some cases, your doctor may suggest that you be tested for influenza. He or she may use various tests to diagnose influenza. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is becoming more common in many hospitals and labs. This test may be done while you're in your doctor's office or in the hospital. PCR testing is more sensitive than other tests and may be able to identify the influenza strain.

## Treatment

Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But if you have severe infection or are at higher risk for complications, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu), zanamivir (Relenza), peramivir (Rapivab) or baloxavir (Xofluza). These drugs may shorten your illness by a day or so and help prevent serious complications.

Oseltamivir is an oral medication. Zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with certain chronic respiratory problems, such as asthma and lung disease.

Antiviral medication side effects may include nausea and vomiting. These side effects may be lessened if the drug is taken with food.

Most circulating strains of influenza have become resistant to amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine), which are older antiviral drugs that are no longer recommended.

**Lifestyle and home remedies**

If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:

    1. **Drink plenty of liquids**. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration.
    2. **Rest**. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection. You may need to change your activity level, depending on your symptoms.
    3. **Consider pain relievers**. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), to combat the achiness associated with influenza. Children and teens recovering from flu-like symptoms should never take aspirin because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition.

To help control the spread of influenza in your community, stay home and keep sick children home until fever has been gone for 24 hours.
