# AIDS

**AIDS** stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome. AIDS is the most advanced stage of HIV disease.

HIV causes AIDS by attacking CD4 cells, which the immune system uses to protect the body from disease. When the immune system loses too many CD4 cells, you are less able to fight off infections and can develop serious, often deadly, infections. These are called opportunistic infections (OIs).

When someone dies of AIDS, death is usually due to OIs or other long-term effects of HIV. AIDS refers to the weakened state of the body’s immune system, which can no longer stop opportunistic infections.

**What tests are used to diagnose HIV?**

Several different tests can be used to diagnose HIV. Healthcare providers determine which test is best for each person.
**Antibody/antigen tests**

Antibody/antigen tests are the most commonly used tests. They can show positive results typically within 18–45 daysTrusted Source after someone initially contracts HIV.

These tests check the blood for antibodies and antigens. An antibody is a type of protein the body makes to fight an infection. An antigen, on the other hand, is the part of the virus that activates the immune system.
**Antibody tests**

These tests check the blood solely for antibodies. Between 23 and 90 daysTrusted Source after transmission, most people will develop detectable HIV antibodies, which can be found in the blood or saliva.

These tests are done using blood tests or mouth swabs, and there’s no preparation necessary. Some tests provide results in 30 minutes or less and can be performed in a healthcare provider’s office or clinic.

Other antibody tests can be done at home:

    1. **OraQuick HIV Test**. An oral swab provides results in as little as 20 minutes.
    2. **Home Access HIV-1 Test System**. After the person pricks their finger, they send a blood sample to a licensed laboratory. They can remain anonymous and call for results the next business day.

If someone suspects they’ve been exposed to HIV but tested negative in a home test, they should repeat the test in three months. If they have a positive result, they should follow up with their healthcare provider to confirm.
**Nucleic acid test (NAT)**

This expensive test isn’t used for general screening. It’s for people who have early symptoms of HIV or have a known risk factor. This test doesn’t look for antibodies; it looks for the virus itself. It takes from 5 to 21 days for HIV to be detectable in the blood. This test is usually accompanied or confirmed by an antibody test.

## Treatment
Adhering to antiretroviral treatment can reduce HIV to an undetectable viral load.

_No cure is currently available for HIV or AIDS._

However, treatments can stop the progression of the condition and allow most people living with HIV the opportunity to live a long and relatively healthy life.

Starting ART early in the progression of the virus is crucial. This improves quality of life, extends life expectancy, and reduces the risk of transmission, according to the WHO’s guidelines from June 2013.

More effective and better-tolerated treatments have evolved that can improve general health and quality of life by taking as little as one pill per day.

A person living with HIV can reduce their viral load to such a degree that it is no longer detectable in a blood test. After assessing a number of large studies, the CDC concluded that individuals who have no detectable viral load “have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner.”

Medical professionals refer to this as undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).
**Emergency HIV pills, or post-exposure prophylaxis**

If an individual believes they have been exposed to the virus within the last 3 days, anti-HIV medications, called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), may be able to stop infection. Take PEP as soon as possible after potential contact with the virus.

PEP is a treatment lasting a total of 28 days, and physicians will continue to monitor for HIV after the completion of the treatment.
**Antiretroviral drugs**

The treatment of HIV involves antiretroviral medications that fight the HIV infection and slows down the spread of the virus in the body. People living with HIV generally take a combination of medications called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) or combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).

**Complementary or alternative medicine**

Although many people who have HIV try complementary, alternative, or herbal options, such as herbal remedies, no evidence confirms them to be effective.

According to some limited studies, mineral or vitamin supplements may provide some benefits in overall health. It is important to discuss these options with a healthcare provider because some of these options, even vitamin supplements, may interact with ARVs.
