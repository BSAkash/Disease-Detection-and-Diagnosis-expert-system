# Pancreatitis

**Pancreatitis** is inflammation in the pancreas. The pancreas is a long, flat gland that sits tucked behind the stomach in the upper abdomen. The pancreas produces enzymes that help digestion and hormones that help regulate the way your body processes sugar (glucose).

Pancreatitis can occur as acute pancreatitis â€” meaning it appears suddenly and lasts for days. Or pancreatitis can occur as chronic pancreatitis, which is pancreatitis that occurs over many years.

Mild cases of pancreatitis may go away without treatment, but severe cases can cause life-threatening complications.

## Diagnosis

Tests and procedures used to diagnose pancreatitis include:

    1. **Blood tests** to look for elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes
    2. **Stool tests** in chronic pancreatitis to measure levels of fat that could suggest your digestive system isn't absorbing nutrients adequately
    3. **Computerized tomography (CT) scan** to look for gallstones and assess the extent of pancreas inflammation
    4. **Abdominal ultrasound** to look for gallstones and pancreas inflammation
    5. **Endoscopic ultrasound** to look for inflammation and blockages in the pancreatic duct or bile duct
    6. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** to look for abnormalities in the gallbladder, pancreas and ducts

Your doctor may recommend other tests, depending on your particular situation.

## Treatment

Treatment for acute pancreatitis will depend on whether it is mild or serious. In mild cases, the risk of complications is small. In serious cases, the risk is significant.
Treatment for mild acute pancreatitis

Treatment aims to maintain bodily function and ease symptoms while the pancreas is repairing itself.

This will include:

    1. **Painkillers**: Mild acute pancreatitis can be moderately or severely painful.
    2. **Nasogastric tubes**: A tube may remove excess liquids and air as a treatment for nausea and vomiting.
    3. **Bowel rest**: The gastrointestinal tract will need to rest for a few days, so the person will not take any food or drink by mouth until their condition improves.
    4. **Preventing dehydration**: Dehydration often accompanies pancreatitis, and it can worsen the symptoms and complications. Fluid is often provided intravenously for the first 24-48 hours.

The person can usually go home after about 5 to 7 days.
Treatment for severe acute pancreatitis

In severe acute pancreatitis, there is usually some tissue death, or necrosis. This increases the risk of sepsis, a severe bacterial infection that can affect the whole body. Sepsis can lead to multi-organ damage or failure.

Severe acute pancreatitis can also cause hypovolemic shock. Severe blood and fluid loss can leave the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. Parts of the body can become rapidly oxygen-deprived. This is a life-threatening situation.

Treatment for this kind of pancreatitis includes:

    1. Treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU): Injections with antibiotics aim to stop any infection from developing in the dead tissue.
    2. Intravenous fluids: These help maintain hydration and prevent hypovolemic shock.
    3. Breathing assistance: Ventilation equipment will help the patient breathe.
    4. Feeding tubes: These provide nutrition as appropriate. In this case, early feeding improves outcomes.
    5. Surgery: In some cases, the dead tissue may need to be surgically removed.

The patient will stay in ICU until they are no longer at risk of organ failure, hypovolemic shock, and sepsis.
**Treating gallstones**

If gallstones caused the acute pancreatitis, the patient might undergo surgery or an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) after their condition improves.

After the gallstones are removed, the patient may be advised to follow a special diet to lower blood cholesterol, because excess cholesterol encourages the growth of gallstones.

The American Gastroenterological Association recommends surgery to remove the gallbladder of any patient who develops pancreatitis from gallstones.
**Treating alcohol misuse**

If doctors determine that alcohol misuse was the underlying cause of the acute pancreatitis, the patient may be offered a treatment program for alcohol misuse.
