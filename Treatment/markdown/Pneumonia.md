# Pneumonia

**Pneumonia** is a bacterial or viral infection of the lungs.  Symptoms can include fever, chills, shortness of breath, coughing that produces phlegm, and chest pain.

## Diagnosis

Your doctor will start by asking about your medical history and doing a physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope to check for abnormal bubbling or crackling sounds that suggest pneumonia.

If pneumonia is suspected, your doctor may recommend the following tests:

    1. **Blood tests**. Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn't always possible.
    2. **Chest X-ray**. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.
    3. **Pulse oximetry**. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.
    4. **Sputum test**. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection.

Your doctor might order additional tests if you're older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include:

    1. **CT scan**. If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.
    2. **Pleural fluid culture.** A fluid sample is taken by putting a needle between your ribs from the pleural area and analyzed to help determine the type of infection.


## Treatment

Most cases of pneumonia can be treated at home. However, babies, children, and people with severe pneumonia may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.
 
Pneumonia is usually treated with antibiotics, even if viral pneumonia is suspected as there may be a degree of bacterial infection as well. The type of antibiotic used and the way it is given will be determined by the severity and cause of the pneumonia.
 
**Home-based treatment** usually includes: 

    1. Antibiotics - given by mouth as tablets or liquid
    2. Pain-relieving medications
    3. Paracetamol to reduce fever
    4. Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, to help loosen mucus in the lungs
    5. Rest.

**Hospital-based treatment** usually includes: 

    1. Antibiotics given intravenously (via a drip into a vein)
    2. Oxygen therapy - to ensure the body gets the oxygen it needs
    3. Intravenous fluids - to correct dehydration or if the person is too unwell to eat or drink
    4. Physiotherapy - to help clear the sputum from the lungs.

**Recovery**

Pneumonia may take several weeks to fully recover from. The cough may continue until the mucus has been cleared from the lungs. This is a part of the recovery process. Fatigue and a reduced ability to exercise may also be experienced.
 
If the cough gets worse or recovery is taking longer than several weeks, see a doctor for further assessment. Smokers should have a chest x-ray after six weeks to confirm complete clearance of the lungs.

## Prevention

The following steps can be taken to reduce the risk of contracting pneumonia:

    1. Breastfeeding your baby (preferably beyond four months) â€“ to help boost their immune system
    2. Quit smoking and ensure a smoke-free household
    3. Keeping your home warm and well-ventilated
    4. Vaccination, in particular against pneumococcal disease, whooping cough , Hib (Haemophilus influenza type b), and influenza
    5. Regular and thorough hand-washing
    6. Avoiding contact with people who have colds, the flu, or other infections.

_Vaccines against pneumococcal disease may not always prevent pneumonia but they may prevent serious complications of pneumonia should infection occur._
