# Arteriosclerosis

**Arteriosclerosis** occurs when the blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients from your heart to the rest of your body (arteries) become thick and stiff — sometimes restricting blood flow to your organs and tissues. Healthy arteries are flexible and elastic, but over time, the walls in your arteries can harden, a condition commonly called hardening of the arteries.

Atherosclerosis is a specific type of arteriosclerosis, but the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Atherosclerosis refers to the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on your artery walls (plaque), which can restrict blood flow.

The plaque can burst, triggering a blood clot. Although atherosclerosis is often considered a heart problem, it can affect arteries anywhere in your body. Atherosclerosis may be preventable and is treatable.

## Diagnosis

During a physical exam, your doctor may find signs of narrowed, enlarged or hardened arteries, including:

    1. A weak or absent pulse below the narrowed area of your artery
    2. Decreased blood pressure in an affected limb
    3. Whooshing sounds (bruits) over your arteries, heard using a stethoscope

Depending on the results of the physical exam, your doctor may suggest one or more diagnostic tests, including:

    1. **Blood tests**. Lab tests can detect increased levels of cholesterol and blood sugar that may increase the risk of atherosclerosis. You'll need to go without eating or drinking anything but water for nine to 12 hours before your blood test.

    Your doctor should tell you ahead of time if this test will be performed during your visit.
    2. **Doppler ultrasound**. Your doctor may use a special ultrasound device (Doppler ultrasound) to measure your blood pressure at various points along your arm or leg. These measurements can help your doctor gauge the degree of any blockages, as well as the speed of blood flow in your arteries.

    3. **Ankle-brachial index**. This test can tell if you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your legs and feet.

    Your doctor may compare the blood pressure in your ankle with the blood pressure in your arm. This is known as the ankle-brachial index. An abnormal difference may indicate peripheral vascular disease, which is usually caused by atherosclerosis.
    4. **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**. An electrocardiogram records electrical signals as they travel through your heart. An ECG can often reveal evidence of a previous heart attack. If your signs and symptoms occur most often during exercise, your doctor may ask you to walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike during an ECG.

    5. **Stress test**. A stress test, also called an exercise stress test, is used to gather information about how well your heart works during physical activity.

    Because exercise makes your heart pump harder and faster than it does during most daily activities, an exercise stress test can reveal problems within your heart that might not be noticeable otherwise.

    An exercise stress test usually involves walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while your heart rhythm, blood pressure and breathing are monitored.

    In some types of stress tests, pictures will be taken of your heart, such as during a stress echocardiogram (ultrasound) or nuclear stress test. If you're unable to exercise, you may receive a medication that mimics the effect of exercise on your heart.

    6. **Cardiac catheterization and angiogram**. This test can show if your coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked.

    A liquid dye is injected into the arteries of your heart through a long, thin tube (catheter) that's fed through an artery, usually in your leg, to the arteries in your heart. As the dye fills your arteries, the arteries become visible on X-ray, revealing areas of blockage.
    7. **Other imaging tests**. Your doctor may use ultrasound, a computerized tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to study your arteries. These tests can often show hardening and narrowing of large arteries, as well as aneurysms and calcium deposits in the artery walls.


## Treatment

Treatment also depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes.

_Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke._ For example:

    1. quit smoking tobacco
    2. reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol
    3. exercise regularly
    4. lose weight to a healthy level
    5. eat a healthy diet (low in fat, low in sodium)

If your condition doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be:

    1. **balloon angioplasty**: to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure
    2. **coronary artery bypass graft surgery**: to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery
    3. **enhanced external counterpulsation**: to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure 

## Prevention

The same lifestyle habits that can help treat coronary artery disease can also help prevent it from developing in the first place. Leading a healthy lifestyle can help keep your arteries strong and clear of plaque. To improve your heart health, you can:

    1. Quit smoking
    2. Control conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes
    3. Stay physically active
    4. Eat a low-fat, low-salt diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains
    5. Maintain a healthy weight
    6. Reduce and manage stress
